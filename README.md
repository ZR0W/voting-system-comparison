A python data app to visually compare the effects of some different major voting systems
# Motivation
Inspired by watching Primer's (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ) YouTube video on "Simulatin alternate voting systems" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhO6jfHPFQU), I've made my own streamlit application to create a interactive web app to display the concepts explored in the video and more.
