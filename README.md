# Voting System Comparison
A python data app to visually compare the effects of some different major voting systems.
### Motivation
Inspired by watching Primer's (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ) YouTube video on "Simulatin alternate voting systems" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhO6jfHPFQU), I've made my own streamlit application to create a interactive web app to display the concepts explored in the video and more.
### Technology and plan of development
The current main goal is to showcase how instant-run-off election and two-round system can produce different results on the same population. the data for the candiates will have to be deliberately chosen to best showcase the effect of the different systems.

Besides adding new voting system to explore, one topic of interst is gerymandering. One thing to consider is how  to visualize this, since currently the graph is used to visualize the population's placement on the political spectrum, and not they're physical location.
